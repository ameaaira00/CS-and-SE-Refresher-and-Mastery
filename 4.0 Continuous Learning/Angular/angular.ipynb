    "- Components: These are the building blocks of Angular applications. A component is a piece of code that controls a part of the UI.\n",
    "- Modules: A module is like a container for your components, services, and other code that belongs together.\n",
    "- Services: Services are used to share data and logic between different parts of your app."

    "## Features of Angular:\n",
    "Two-way data binding:\n",
    "- Angular uses two-way data binding to keep the view and model in sync at all times.\n",
    "- Data is automatically updated in the view (what we see) whenever it changes in the model (our data source).\n",
    "\n",
    "Component-based architecture:\n",
    "- Angular is built around the concept of components.\n",
    "- Our app is split into components, each responsible for controlling a part of the UI.\n",
    "- Reusable components can be used in different parts of the app.\n",
    "- Depends on us to create components that are small, reusable, and focused on a single task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Injection:\n",
    "- Angular uses dependency injection to provide components with the services they need.\n",
    "- Instead of creating services inside components, we can inject them into the component's constructor.\n",
    "- How to use dependency injection in Angular:\n",
    "  - Create a service.\n",
    "  - Register the service with Angular.\n",
    "  - Inject the service into a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing:\n",
    "- Angular provides a router that allows us to navigate between different parts of our app without reloading the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directives and Pipes:\n",
    "- Directives are special instructions that tell Angular how to modify the DOM.\n",
    "    - ex. `ngIf`, `ngFor`, `ngStyle`, `ngClass`\n",
    "- Pipes are used to transform data in the template.\n",
    "    ```html\n",
    "    <p>{{ today | date }}</p>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- We can also create custom pipes to transform data in our own way."

    "# Components\n",
    "The fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They are responsible for rendering the UI and responding to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Component\n",
    "Every Angular component consists of the following core parts:\n",
    "1. `@Component` decorator: This is a function that takes a metadata object as an argument. It tells Angular that this class is a component.\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "import { Component } from '@angular/core';\n",
    "\n",
    "@Component({\n",
    "  selector: 'app-root',\n",
    "  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n",
    "  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n",
    "})\n",
    "export class AppComponent {\n",
    "  title = 'My App';\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. HTML template: This is the view part of the component. It defines the structure of the component.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>{{ title }}</h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CSS styles: These are the styles that are applied to the component.\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  color: blue;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TypeScript class: This is the code that defines the component's behavior. Responsible for managing state, handling user interactions, interacting with services, and fetching data from the server.\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "export class AppComponent {\n",
    "  title = 'My App';\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Common Metadata Properties:\n",
    "- `selector`: The CSS selector that identifies this component in a template.\n",
    "- `templateUrl`: The URL of the file containing the component's template.\n",
    "- `template`: The inline template for the component.\n",
    "- `styleUrls`: An array of URLs of files containing the component's styles.\n",
    "- `styles`: An array of inline styles for the component.\n",
    "- `providers`: An array of providers for the component.\n",
    "- `standalone`: Whether the component should be treated as a standalone component.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Components\n",
    "An advantage of component architecture is that we can reuse components across different parts of our application (modular design).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a component, we need to:\n",
    "1. Import the component class.\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add it to the component's `declarations` array in the module where we want to use it.\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "@NgModule({\n",
    "  imports: [\n",
    "    AboutComponent\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the component's selector to the template where we want to use it.\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<app-about></app-about>\n",
    "```"
