    "## Quicksort\n",
    "- A fast sorting algorithm.\n",
    "- Uses divide and conquer to sort a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide and Conquer\n",
    "This is a technique of breaking a problem into smaller pieces, solving the smaller pieces, and then combining those solutions to solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put D&C simply:\n",
    "1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem.\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Solve the subproblems.\n",
    "3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions to solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Example\n",
    "Suppose you have a plot of land and you need to divide it evenly into square plots. You can use D&C to solve this problem: \n",
    "1. Figure out the base case.\n",
    "2. Divide the land until you reach the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have 1680 x 640 meters of land. \n",
    "1. Figure out the base \n",
    "- The base case is when the land is a square plot. So each side is the same length.\n",
    "2. Divide the land\n",
    "- Recall that the land is 1680 x 640 meters.\n",
    "- Get the biggest square plot that fits into the land.\n",
    "ex. We get 2 square plots of 640 x 640 meters. Which leaves us with (1680-2*640) = 400 x 640 meters.\n",
    "- Left 400 x 640 meters of land. \n",
    "We can get 1 square plot of 400 x 400 meters. Which leaves us with (640-400) = 240 x 400 meters.\n",
    "- Left 240 x 400 meters of land.\n",
    "We can get 1 square plot of 240 x 240 meters. Which leaves us with (400-240) = 160 x 240 meters.\n",
    "- Left 160 x 240 meters of land.\n",
    "We can get 1 square plot of 160 x 160 meters. Which leaves us with (240-160) = 80 x 160 meters.\n",
    "- Left 80 x 160 meters of land.\n",
    "We can get 2 even square plots of 80 x 80 meters. We have reached the base case!\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the biggest plot size is 80 x 80 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclid's Algorithm\n",
    "Euclid's algorithm is a classic example of D&C. It finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works for 48 and 18:\n",
    "1. **Divide**: Divide the larger number by the smaller number.\n",
    "48 divided by 18 is 2 with a remainder of 12.\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder.\n",
    "18 divided by 12 is 1 with a remainder of 6.\n",
    "3. **Combine**: Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n",
    "12 divided by 6 is 2 with a remainder of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the greatest common divisor of 48 and 18 is 6."
