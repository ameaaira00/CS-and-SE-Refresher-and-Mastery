    "## Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is a basic way to sort a list by **repeatedly finding the smallest item and moving it to the correct position.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. You start with two parts in the list: \n",
    "   - One part is **sorted** (starts empty).\n",
    "   - The other part is **unsorted**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Find the **smallest item** in the unsorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Swap that smallest item with the first item of the unsorted part, moving it to the sorted part.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Keep repeating this process: find the next smallest item, swap it, and grow the sorted part of the list until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "- You're always moving the smallest item to the front until the whole list is sorted.\n",
    "\n"
   ]

    "### Time Complexity: $O(n²)$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Loop**: You go through the list once for each item to find the smallest. This takes **n** steps for a list with $n$ items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Loop**: For each item, you compare it with the rest of the list to find the smallest one. On the first pass, you make about $n$ comparisons, then $n-1$, $n-2$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it O(n²)?\n",
    "- You’re doing $n$ comparisons for each of the **n** items.\n",
    "- This results in about $n × n = n^2$ operations, or $O(n²)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What About Constants?\n",
    "Even though fewer elements are compared as the list gets sorted, Big O notation ignores constants and focuses on the overall growth. So the time complexity is still $O(n²)$, even though the number of comparisons decreases slightly as sorting progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation:\n",
    "- $n$ comparisons for the first item.\n",
    "- $n-1$ comparisons for the second item.\n",
    "- and so on.\n",
    "- $1$ comparison for the last item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of comparisons is:\n",
    "- $n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1$.\n",
    "- This is the sum of the first $n$ integers.\n",
    "- The sum of the first $n$ integers is $n(n+1)/2$.\n",
    "- So, the total number of comparisons is $n(n+1)/2$.\n",
    "- To be precise, it's $O(n^2 + n)/2$.\n",
    "- But, we ignore the lower order term and the constant factor, so the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, **Selection Sort** is slow for large lists."
