    "**Hash Function in Action**:\n",
    "We never have to implement a hash function from scratch. Programming languages provide built-in hash functions that we can use to create hash tables. Whew! 😅 \n",
    "But for the curious minds, here's how a hash function works:\n",
    "1. It takes a key as input.\n",
    "2. It performs some calculations on the key.\n",
    "ex. `hash('apple') = 4`\n",
    "3. It returns an index based on the calculations.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def hash(key):\n",
    "    return len(key) % 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the hash function calculates the length of the key and returns the remainder when divided by 10. This way, the hash function maps keys to indices within the range of 0 to 9.\n",

    "    - **Linear Probing**: Searching for the next available slot.\n",
    "    - **Quadratic Probing**: Using a quadratic function to find the next slot.\n",
    "    - **Double Hashing**: Using a second hash function to find the next slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions are essential. Ideally it would map keys evenly across the hash table to avoid collisions. \n",
    "- In Separate Chaining, if the linked list grows too long, it can slow down the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hash Table has keys and values.\n",
    "- **Keys**: Unique identifiers for values.\n",
