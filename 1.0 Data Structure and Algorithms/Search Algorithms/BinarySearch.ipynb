    "Binary search is a classic algorithm that takes in a sorted array and a target value and returns the index of the target value in the array. If the target value is not in the array, it returns $-1$ or $null$.\n",

    "If the array is not sorted, you have to sort it first. Hence, for unsorted arrays, the time complexity of binary search is $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
