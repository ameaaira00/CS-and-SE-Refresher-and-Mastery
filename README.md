# **CS and SE Refresher & Mastery by Aira Aloveros**

This repository is a collection of my notes and practice coding as I continuously refine my computer science knowledge, improve software engineering skills, and stay updated with modern technologies. It includes both theoretical notes and practical projects across various domains of computer science and full-stack development.

I am a visual learner, so to study, I will combine taking notes and creating diagrams on GoodNotes and Google Docs, highlighting materials, and engaging in actual coding to retain knowledge better.

## 💻 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/CS and SE Refresher & Mastery
├── 1.0 Data Structure and Algorithms
│   ├── Algorithms.ipynb
│   ├── DataStructures.ipynb
│   ├── Search Algorithm
│   │   └── BinarySearch.ipynb
│   └── Sorting Algorithm
│       └── SelectionSort.ipynb
├── TO FILL...
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains notes, code, and projects related to the corresponding topics. I will be using a mix of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for note-taking and coding practice, along with standalone files for project implementations.

## 🎯 Goals

The aim of this repository is to:
- Maintain a strong foundation in core computer science concepts.
- Continuously improve as a Software Engineer.
- Gain practical experience in cloud computing, DevOps, and emerging technologies.

*Disclaimer: Parts of this repository may have utilized tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to assist in generating code and explanations. However, for actual coding projects and coding practices, my goal is to minimize dependency on these AI tools to better improve my skills.*
